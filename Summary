The Machine Learning Model was made by looping through multiple images of covid and normal lungs converting the data to NumPy arrays and scaling the pixel intensitites. 
Then it runs througe the dataset matching the image name with ether Normal or Covid to enshure accuracy of the divition of the images. 
The it begins looping through the machine learning epochs while also showing the accuarcy sensitivity of the trainging.
I only had it run through 25 Epocs becuse I belived that it would be enouge to give at lease a 90% accuacy.
During the programe I had it ploting the training loss value loss training accuract and value accuacy in matplotlib
After 25 Epocs it had about a 90% accuacy of detecting wheather or not the Machine Learning model can detect Covid or normal healthy lungs.
I used a programe called imageAI it is a python library that is built for image requintion machine learning.
It allowed me to make a much simpler machine learning program then having to configue everything from start to finish it allowed
me to simply scale the image data the seperate the covid vs normal in difrent files and the programe did the rest of the work.
